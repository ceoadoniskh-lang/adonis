    "introText": "Adonis is a Ukrainian sewing factory that since 2002 has been creating women's outerwear that combines comfort, elegance and impeccable fit. We know how important it is for every woman — regardless of size — to feel confident and beautiful. That's why our collections cover a wide size range — from 42 to 80. Our main qualification is the production of women's outerwear. At the same time, we have experience in developing men's collections and children's models, which allows us to flexibly implement various partner requests. For rational use of resources and minimization of production waste, we give fabrics a second life. We use leftover materials after sewing main Adonis collections to create stylish and practical accessories — bags, cosmetic cases and protective cases for beauty master tools. This approach allows us not only to care for the environment, but also to create useful products with unique design. We work with love for details: from cutting to finishing, from fabric selection to hardware. Our jackets, coats and vests are the result of experience, craftsmanship and modern technologies, including our own embroidery and quilting services. Adonis is more than just production. It's a team that understands that every product is a story that combines style, quality and care.",
