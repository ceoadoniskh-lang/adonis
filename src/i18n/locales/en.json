    "introText": "The history of our enterprise began in 1988. It all started with a small shoe workshop.\n\nIn 1992, the ADONIS brand officially appeared.\n\nSince then, production has developed, technologies have improved, volumes have increased, and we were first presented on the international market. That is why the brand symbol remains unchanged — boots with the Adonis flower, which still reminds us of the company's footwear origins today.\n\nSince 2002, the enterprise began a new chapter in its history — the production of women's outerwear.\n\nOur main principles remain unchanged: experience, quality, professionalism.\n\nWe know how important it is for every woman — regardless of size — to feel confident and beautiful. That is why our collections cover a wide size range — from 42 to 80.\n\nOur main qualification now is the production of women's outerwear. At the same time, we have experience in developing men's collections and children's models, which allows us to flexibly implement various partner requests.\n\nFor rational use of resources and minimization of production waste, we give fabrics a second life. We use leftover materials after sewing main Adonis collections to create stylish and practical accessories — bags, cosmetic cases and protective cases for beauty master tools. This approach allows us not only to care for the environment, but also to create useful products with unique design.\n\nWe work with love for details: from cutting to finishing, from fabric selection to hardware. Our jackets, coats and vests are the result of experience, craftsmanship and modern technologies, including our own embroidery and quilting services.\n\nAdonis is more than just production. It's a team that understands that every product is a story that combines style, quality and care.",
